  <div class="page-body container" data-animate-in="up" data-animate-in-delay="300">

    <h2 class="h1" data-animate-in="up">Event Terms</h2>

    <p>By RSVP’ing or attending GitHub Universe, including any of the events or activities organized by GitHub in association with the GitHub Universe (collectively the “Event”), you signal that you have read, understand, and agree to the following Event Terms and Conditions.</p>

    <br><br>
    <h3 id="harassment-is-not-tolerated" class="h3">1. Harassment is not tolerated</h3>

    <p>You will abide by the Code of Conduct which seeks to provide a harassment-free event experience for everyone.</p>

    <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

    <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

    <p>Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Offensive jokes are not appropriate and will not be tolerated under any circumstance at this event.</p>

    <p>If a participant engages in behavior that violates the Code of Conduct, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event or conference with no refund (if applicable) (it usually isn’t).</p>

    <br><br>
    <h3 id="basics-in-order-to-attend" class="h3">2. Basics in order to attend</h3>

    <p>In order to participate in the Event, you represent that (a) you have the requisite power and authority to enter into these Event Terms, and (b) you have read and understood these Event Terms as well as the GitHub.com Terms of Service.</p>

    <p>In order to attend a GitHub event where alcohol is being served, you represent that you are at least 21 years old, or otherwise over the legal drinking age in your jurisdiction.</p>

    <br><br>
    <h3 id="pictures" class="h3">3. Pictures</h3>

    <p>GitHub or its partners sometimes take photos and videos at GitHub events. By participating or attending the Event, you agree that you may appear in some of these photos and videos, and you authorize GitHub’s use of them. On the flip side, if you take any photos or videos of attendees at the Event and provide them to us, you authorize us to use them in the same fashion, and represent that the attendees that appear in your photos and videos have also consented to such use.</p>

    <br><br>
    <h3 id="assumption-of-risk--release-of-liability--indemnity" class="h3">4. Assumption of Risk / Release of Liability / Indemnity</h3>

    <p>(a) Assumption of Risk. Although we try to create a safe environment at the Event, accidents or other bad things happen, even to good people. We ask that you do your part to help limit the possibility that you might get injured at the Event.</p>

    <p>You agree to carefully consider the risks inherent in any activities that you choose to take part in and to take reasonable precautions before you choose to attend or participate at a GitHub event. For example, you should ensure that you are in good physical health before engaging in any physical activity at a GitHub event, and you should always drink responsibly given the risks associated with drunk driving and participating in activities while your judgment is impaired. It’s always good to remember that other event guests may be less responsible than you, and may themselves create additional risk to you despite their best intentions.</p>

    <p>In short, you understand that your attendance and participation at any GitHub event is voluntary, and you agree to assume responsibility for any resulting injuries to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law.</p>

    <p>By the same token, you agree that GitHub is not responsible for any injuries or accidents that you might sustain at any events that GitHub doesn’t organize or control.</p>

    <p>(b) Release of Liability. You (for yourself, your heirs, personal representatives, or assigns, and anyone else who might make a claim on your behalf) hereby release, waive, discharge and covenant not to sue GitHub and its respective parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, partners, shareholders, members, agents, employees, vendors, sponsors, and volunteers from any and all claims, demands, causes of action, damages, losses or expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys fees) which may arise out of, result from, or relate in any way to your attendance at the Event or any related event, except, of course, for any gross negligence or willful misconduct on our part.</p>

    <p>(c) Indemnity. By the same token, you agree to indemnify and hold GitHub, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives harmless, including costs, liabilities and legal fees, from any claim or demand made by any third party due to, related to, or connected with your attendance or conduct at the Event or any related event.</p>

    <br><br>
    <h3 id="termination" class="h3">5. Termination</h3>

    <p>While we hope not to, GitHub may prohibit your attendance at any GitHub event at any time if you fail to abide by these Event Terms and the Code of Conduct, the GitHub.com Terms of Service, or for any or no reason, without notice or liability of any kind. Section 4 will continue to apply following any termination.</p>

    <br><br>
    <h3 id="choice-of-law-and-venue" class="h3">6. Choice of law and venue</h3>

    <p>California law will govern these Event Terms, as well as any claim, cause of action or dispute that might arise between you and GitHub (a “Claim”), without regard to conflict of law provisions. FOR ANY CLAIM BROUGHT BY EITHER PARTY, YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT AND CONSENT TO THE PERSONAL AND EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION IN, AND THE EXCLUSIVE VENUE OF, THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED WITHIN SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA.</p>

    <br><br>
    <h3 id="miscellaneous-terms" class="h3">7. Miscellaneous Terms</h3>

    <p>You agree that you will not represent yourself as an employee, representative, or agent of GitHub (unless, of course, you are actually employed by GitHub). We reserve the right to cancel the Event or any related event at any time, for any reason, and without liability or prejudice. Any failure on GitHub’s part to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these terms does not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Event Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.</p>

    <br><br>
    <h3 id="license" class="h3">License</h3>

    <p>This Code of Conduct was forked from the example policy from the <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy">Geek Feminism wiki, created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers</a>. which is under a Creative Commons Zero license.</p>
